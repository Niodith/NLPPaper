This repository is used for the uni seminar to evaluate the Rotowire deep learning from https://github.com/KaijuML/data-to-text-hierarchical.

The instructions on using can be found [here] (onmt/README.md).

In this repo are the preprocessed data and a lightly trained model as well as the adaption to the newer open NMT framework.
