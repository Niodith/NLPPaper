    "In the area of expertise of handling complex data machines still outmatch (most) humans. In the area of Data Science processing of named data machine learning became a key component in the repertoire of most data scientists.\n",
    "But humans outmatch machines in one important part - dealing and handling natural languges - this subdiscipline of data scienes needed most of the time a human to yield desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fields of *natural language processing* and *natural language generation* are key to use the benefits of machine learning to its fullest - while keeping the ability of machines to deal with data(structs) way more efficient than a human it adds a \"human\" coponent to the machine to get natrual seeming resuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Natural language processing* dates back before even the digital computer were invented - a famous example is Warren Weaver whose efforts of code decoding were mainly during World War II. [https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pjh/sem1a5/pt1/pt1_history.html]\n",
    "Natural language processing enables the machine to get its data it needs for in depth analysis out of seemingly unstructured languages and the possibility to learn from *human* generated text to improve itself for more natural *machine* generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Natural language generation* is compared a newer technology - first mostly used in chatbots it found its way into the toolkits of data scientist and lingustics alike. Since 2014 until 2017 job possibilities in natural language generation and deep learning grew from a not mention worthy number to 41,000 jobs - a significant increase which is likely to be linked to an higher demand in this diciplines.

    "An important use of *natural language generation* is the so called *data-to-text* generation- it is used to mimicry human wiriting and text based on the data a human normally would refer to in his or her text. The most used example for this is RotoWire a webpage which contains the statistics of match outcomes of many different sports plus the journalistic description of named matches e.G. NBA basketball matches. [https://www.rotowire.com/]\n",

    "This matching of data-to-text made buy a human is a welcome base for machine learning to teach that task to a machine. With a *encoder - decoder* system the RotoWire datasets can be \"translated\" into seemingly human written texts.[https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4653]\n",
    "An *encoder* acts as an combinational circuit in which a dataset will be encoded into the desired form with the corresponding algorithm while an *decoder* reverts this process with the encoded data.\n",
